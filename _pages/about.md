Welcome to my website! 

My name is Seoyun Hong, and I also go by Stella. I am a PhD candidate in economics at Boston University. 

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
My research is at the intersection of econometrics and applied microeconomics, including labor economics and industrial organization. In econometrics, I develop new causal inference methods that leverage machine learning and high-dimensional data. In applied microeconomics, I address central empirical questions by developing estimators tailored to each problem, such as analyzing the gender wage gap across work hours and the price effects of collusion in procurement auctions.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market.

    This paper develops estimation and inference for heterogeneous treatment effects by observed covariates in settings with an endogenous treatment and high-dimensional covariates. The goal is to provide valid inference when effect heterogeneity is high-dimensional and discovered from the data using machine learning, rather than restricted to a few prespecified covariates. I estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by interacting the treatment with all covariates and select the relevant interactions with a variable selection method. I address endogeneity with instrumental variables and uncover new patterns in treatment effects. In an application to Head Start, a public early childhood education program, I examine complementarities between center characteristics and children's background, while prior work has considered center or child characteristics in isolation. The proposed method reveals that frequent home visits are most helpful for children who likely need additional support, such as those with teen mothers or in high-risk households. Transportation services deliver larger gains for children who may face access barriers.
